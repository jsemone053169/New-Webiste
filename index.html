    <h2 class="about-me-header">About Me</h2>
    <p class="about-me-content">
      Hi, I&#39m Jennifer! I&#39m an accounting professional, located in New Jersey, with over 30 years of experience, and I&#39ve had the pleasure of working across a wide variety of industries—consulting engineering, chemical manufacturing, legal services, dry cleaning, franchise management, creative services, and plenty more. I love getting to know how different businesses work and finding the best ways that strong accounting can support their success.
    </p>
    <p class="about-me-content">
      Throughout my career, I&#39ve taken on roles like full-charge bookkeeper, payroll administrator, accounting manager, and controller. Most of my work has been in small to mid-sized companies where flexibility is key, so I&#39ve jumped in wherever needed—HR and benefits administration, database management, employee onboarding, and everything in between.
    </p>
    <p class="about-me-content">
      I&#39m a direct communicator who values clarity and honesty. I believe in being straightforward, practical, and solution-focused. While my style is no-nonsense, it comes from a genuine passion for doing things right and treating people with respect. Professionalism and integrity are at the core of how I work.
    </p>
    <p class="about-me-content">
      I also understand just how impactful accurate financial information is. It shapes hiring decisions, guides investments, and influences a company&#39s direction. Knowing my work helps leaders make smart choices is something I take seriously—and take pride in.
    </p>
    <p class="about-me-content">
      On the technical side, I&#39m strong in Excel (dashboards, pivot tables, VBA, and macros), and I&#39m comfortable with PowerPoint and Access. I&#39ve built real-time dashboards in Looker Studio, pulling in data from external sources to make reporting more dynamic and useful. I&#39ve even taken time to learn basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—and used those skills to build this website.
    </p>
    <p class="about-me-content">
      I&#39m always excited about opportunities to contribute, grow, learn new things, and work with teams who value accuracy and continuous improvement.

      <h2 class="results">Results</h2>
       <p class="content">
        I bring a proven track record of transforming accounting operations to improve efficiency, accuracy, and financial performance. At a creative services agency, I established all core accounting processes and procedures, setting a strong foundation for scalable growth. I boosted cash flow by 47% through the development and implementation of a streamlined invoicing and collections workflow. In addition to increasing cash flow with improved invoice and collection methods, I partnered with our internal developer to add a payment page to the company website. By integrating with <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank">Stripe</a>, clients were given the choice to pay invoices securely online through this dedicated portal.
       </p>
       <p class="content">
         I led the setup, data migration, and team training for the Advantage Aqua integrated project management and accounting system. I also created an automated PTO request and record-keeping system that virtually eliminated manual entry and increased accuracy by 90%. My month-end close process was optimized to deliver timely and reliable financial results to leadership by the 8th of each month. In partnership with leadership, I developed a comprehensive project cost estimate template that modeled gross-to-net profitability across multiple margin scenarios, including customizable inputs.
       </p>
       <p class="content">
        Additionally, I spearheaded all efforts related to the PPP loan application and forgiveness process, resulting in full forgiveness of both principal and interest.
       </p>

      <p class="content">
        With over 30 years of accounting and finance experience across diverse industries—including consulting engineering, advertising, legal services, dry cleaning, and other service-based organizations—I bring deep expertise in full-cycle accounting through financial statement preparation. I have developed income statement revenue goals designed to achieve targeted net profit margins of 10%, 15%, and 20%, and I am skilled in both zero-based budgeting and forecasting built on historical performance.
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        My background includes project-based cost valuation and estimating, as well as the maintenance of fixed asset and prepaid accounts supported by detailed schedules. I also have extensive experience liaising with outside accounting firms to support tax planning, audits, reconciliations, and year-end close activities, ensuring accuracy, compliance, and a streamlined financial process.
